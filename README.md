# SQLiteDBBrowser

First, you need to install SQLite into Raspberry Pi. First, there is a good practice to update the cache with the command run from the terminal:

`sudo apt-get update`

Then install the SQLite package:

`sudo apt-get install sqlite3`

Then you can install SQLite browser:

`sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser`

This is all you need to start using the SQLite manager. From this point, you can close the terminal screen and perform all necessary operations from the GUI.
